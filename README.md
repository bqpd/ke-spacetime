I wanted to represent the current time of year using the position of the Sun, Earth, and Moon in their orbits.

The position of the Earth in orbit around the Sun indicates the hour of year. The Earth itself is a pie chart indicating the second of day. The Moon's position in orbit around the Earth indicates the hour of month. The time is updated every second.
