A decimal-time clock showing the Sun, Earth, and Moon.

Forked from [clayzermk1][1] and inspired by the unit [刻][2](ke) from the Chinese decimal time system of the Shang dynasty / Bronze Age.

A 刻 is a hundredth of a day, and (in some of the calendars) a 分 (fen) forms one hundredth of a 刻.

From left to right the displays are: percent of the year completed, 刻, 分, percent of the month completed.
